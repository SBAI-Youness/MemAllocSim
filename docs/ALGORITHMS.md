# üß† Memory Allocation Algorithms in Operating Systems

## A. Contiguous Memory Allocation Algorithms
These algorithms allocate a single continuous block of memory to a process.

### 1. First Fit
- Allocates the first available block that's large enough.
- ‚úÖ Fast
- ‚ùå Causes fragmentation at the start of memory.

### 2. Best Fit
- Allocates the smallest block that fits the request.
- ‚úÖ Reduces wasted space
- ‚ùå Leaves many small unusable holes (external fragmentation).

### 3. Worst Fit
- Allocates the largest available block.
- ‚úÖ Leaves big leftover space
- ‚ùå Often leads to high fragmentation.

### 4. Next Fit
- Like First Fit but continues search from the last allocated block.
- ‚úÖ Can be faster than First Fit
- ‚ùå Still leads to fragmentation.

## B. Non-Contiguous Memory Allocation Techniques
These allow process memory to be split across non-adjacent blocks.

### 1. Paging
- Memory is divided into fixed-size pages and frames.
- ‚úÖ No external fragmentation
- ‚ùå Overhead from page tables.

### 2. Segmentation
- Memory is divided based on logical segments (code, data, stack).
- ‚úÖ Logical organization
- ‚ùå Suffers from external fragmentation.

### 3. Segmented Paging (or Paged Segmentation)
- Hybrid: segments are divided into pages.
- ‚úÖ Benefits of both segmentation and paging
- ‚ùå Increased complexity.

## C. Buddy System Allocation
A compromise between performance and memory utilization.

### 1. Buddy System
- Memory is allocated in powers of two.
- Blocks can be split and merged with their "buddies".
- ‚úÖ Fast allocation and deallocation
- ‚ùå Internal fragmentation from size rounding.

---

## D. Slab Allocation (Kernel Level)
Used for efficiently allocating memory for objects of the same size.

### 1. Slab Allocator
- Preallocates slabs for frequent object types.
- ‚úÖ Minimizes fragmentation
- ‚úÖ Fast object allocation
- ‚ùå Less efficient for variable-size objects.

---

## E. Heap-Based Dynamic Allocation (User-Level Libraries)
These are used by applications via functions like `malloc` and `free`.

### 1. malloc Implementations (ptmalloc, jemalloc, tcmalloc)
- Use a mix of:
  - First Fit / Best Fit
  - Segregated free lists
  - Bins by size classes
  - Chunk splitting and merging
- ‚úÖ Highly optimized
- ‚ùå Complex internal logic

---

## F. Virtual Memory Techniques
Used by OS to extend physical memory with disk-based storage.

### 1. Demand Paging
- Pages are loaded into RAM only when accessed.
- ‚úÖ Efficient memory use
- ‚ùå Page faults can slow performance.

### 2. Swapping
- Whole processes or memory regions are moved to disk.
- ‚úÖ Increases usable memory
- ‚ùå Very slow, affects performance.
